** @brief HW4_TutteParameterization
**
** This file presents the basic framework of a "node", which processes inputs
** received from the left and outputs specific variables for downstream nodes to
** use.
** - In the first function, node_declare, you can set up the node's input and
** output variables.
** - The second function, node_exec is the execution part of the node, where we
** need to implement the node's functionality.
** - The third function generates the node's registration information, which
** eventually allows placing this node in the GUI interface.
**
** Your task is to fill in the required logic at the specified locations
** within this template, especially in node_exec.

    ** In this task, you are required to generate a 'minimal surface' mesh with
    ** the boundary of the input mesh as its boundary.
    **
    ** Specifically, the positions of the boundary vertices of the input mesh
    ** should be fixed. By solving a global Laplace equation on the mesh,
    ** recalculate the coordinates of the vertices inside the mesh to achieve
    ** the minimal surface configuration.
    **
    ** (Recall the Poisson equation with Dirichlet Boundary Condition in HW3)
    */

    /*
    ** Algorithm Pseudocode for Minimal Surface Calculation
    ** ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** 1. Initialize mesh with input boundary conditions.
    **    - For each boundary vertex, fix its position.
    **    - For internal vertices, initialize with initial guess if necessary.
    **
    ** 2. Construct Laplacian matrix for the mesh.
    **    - Compute weights for each edge based on the chosen weighting scheme
    **      (e.g., uniform weights for simplicity).
    **    - Assemble the global Laplacian matrix.
    **
    ** 3. Solve the Laplace equation for interior vertices.
    **    - Apply Dirichlet boundary conditions for boundary vertices.
    **    - Solve the linear system (Laplacian * X = 0) to find new positions
    **      for internal vertices.
    **
    ** 4. Update mesh geometry with new vertex positions.
    **    - Ensure the mesh respects the minimal surface configuration.
    **
    ** Note: This pseudocode outlines the general steps for calculating a
    ** minimal surface mesh given fixed boundary conditions using the Laplace
    ** equation. The specific implementation details may vary based on the mesh
    ** representation and numerical methods used.
